# Git, Github, and Cats

This repository contains introductory presentation materials on Git and Github.  The presentation provide a high level conceptual overview of version control with Git and basic concepts of Github.  We follow that up by working through the [cheatsheet](git_github_cheatsheet.md) for more hands-on examples.
