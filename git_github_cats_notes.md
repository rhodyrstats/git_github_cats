1. title
 - High level overview of core concepts behind Git and GitHub
  - 1.what is git?
  - 2.how does github relate?
  - 3.can i use it for my EPA work?
 - Will pass off to Ben to show example with CMAQ
 - Plus cats...
2. Cats?/
 -  Cats becuase this was initially an ignite talk
 -  Upon being reminded of that talk, i said all I was going to have
    time for was 5 minutes of cat slides
 -  so, cats!
3. Git?
 - distributed version control system (DVCS)
 - mostly used to track versions of code, but...
 - for any text (code, manuscript, webiste, grocery list...)
 - binary files too, but at file level
 - track all changes by multiple contributors and allows you to retrieve the text at any prior version
 - think of it as Super Undo!!!  ctrl-z that works for each and every time you save a document
 - Based around concept of repositories (essentially a folder with every file init possible tracked)
4. Who created it and why?
 - Created by linux community as a homegrown version control system for linux
 - believe it or not, prior to developing git, linux version control done with a commercial solution 
   (BitKeeper).  in 2005 that stopped and Git was born.
5. Commands?
 - git, like the linux community that developed it is a command line interface (CLI)
 - submitted via the shell
 - start with git, then command, then options, then arguments
 - many GUIs exist (Rstudio, Github for windows,Git GUI)
 - But CLI is quicker and easier to implement in most cases.
 - now for some of the basics
6. git add -A
 - Probably should re-title slide since -A is not always a best practice ...
 - After some edits have been made, git will know that a file has changed since the last commit (more later)
 - These are now "untracked files"
 - use git add -A (or filename) to add all untracked files (or file(s)) to the staging area.
 - These files are now being tracked by git and ready to commit
7. git commit -m
 - git commit takes all the files in the staging area and submits them to the project history
 - somewhat analagous to save
   - although different as you are saving a version of a file, not a new file 
 - This version that you just created will now exist for ever to return to if you need it.  
 - This all happens in the same file, no need for v1 v2 v3_jwh v4 v4_realone.....
 - All commits also require a message (-m) these are important as you use them to understand what changes were made at each commit
8. git clone URL
 - First two commands are the basic workflow, next set are for managing your repositories
 - clone, does just that, makes an exact copy of another repository
 - Useful if you want to work on someone elses repo (code, manuscript, etc)
 - can be local, on network drive, or via remote URL (think Github)
9. git remote -v
 - remote URL can be URLs, other repos on networked filesytem etc.
 - -v lists those that have been set
 - this is the location from which you clone or where you submit and or get recent changes.
 - the remote is usually the master repository (ie where everyone submits there changes)
10. git pull origin master 
 - So you have a cloned repo that others are also working on (or you are working on a separate machine)
 - it is possible that the copy you are working on is not the most up-to-date
 - pull gets those from your remote. 
 - origin is a short name for the URL of the remote
 - master is the local branch into which your pull everything (bit more on branches later)
 - simple case you can always use master and never really worry about branches
11. git push origin gh-pages
 - So, you've made changes and committed to your local repository
 - push is how you get those sent to the master remote repository
 - again, origin is simply a shorthand for your remote
 - gh-pages (could have been master, just messing with things) is the local branch that has committed changes to push 
12. git checkout master
 - if you have multiple branches (e.g  master AND gh-pages)
 - checkout lets you switch between them
 - git branch lets you list them or create them
 - So I have spent just over a minute and half on git commands.
 - You are no presumably experts
 - Next, I am going to talk about github
13. GitHub?
 - so what is github?
 - it is a company, founded in 2008 
 - it is a website, purpose is to provide easy way to share code
 - it is a social network where you can follow, star, and discuss others work
 - based on git, but ...
14. Github != Git
 - they are not the same.
 - Github is based on git, 
   - you need git to use the version control parts of Github
 - some things on Github can be used without Git (ie. it is a website)
 - In short git and Github are complimentary, but separate
15. Fork it
 - Forking
 - Essentially this is cloning a Github repo from one user to another user
 - Both the source and the forked repo stay up on github
 - Usually followed by a git clone to a local machine
16. Pull Requests
 - once you've forked a repo, you can work on it.
 - if you make changes that you think  would be good in the original repo you need how do you do that
 - A pull request.  
 - You do that by pushing to your own version then requesting that owner of the original repo
   pull in your changes (hence, Pull Request) 
 - getting the pull v push stuff straight can be a bit of a challenge
 - good way to work with multiple authors on a paper.  
 - Same general concept of track changes and then one person "pulls" those in.
 - only difference is the history of all the various versions are saved!
17. I've got issues
 - term comes from software development world
 - essentially a discussion forum.
 - discuss bugs
 - discuss enhancements
 - discuss new directions
 - each are tracked, with numbers, can be assigned to people and so on.
 - again think how this could be used to deal with manuscript development and review!
18. Open Collaboration
 - As github is a social network and repo's are, for the free versions, public (read, not write)
   open collaboration is at the heart of github
 - can have organizations, team members, and collaborators
19. EPA?
 - this all great, but can we use this at EPA?
 - yes, sort of...
 - US EPA organizational account
 - Repos are private by default, but if get managerial approval can go Public
 - takes 1 - Few days to set up (many emails, approvals, listing in the RCS)
 - Can be made public upon manager approval
 - Currently only CC0, Public Domain Dedication is allowed for Federal projects
   - works OK in most cases
   - Trying to get approval for other Open Source Initiative approved licenses (eg. MIT, Apache, GPL)
 - Outisde collabs can now be added to private repos (recent change)
20. References
 - lastly some great stuff here.
 - one that is missing is the Pro Git book available from the git-scm site.
